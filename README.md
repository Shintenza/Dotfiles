# Dotfiles

This is my collection of config files. If you like dark colors, simplicity and efficiency, probably you will like it. Whole configuration is original but feel free to modify it and simply use it. 

## This repo contains configs for:

* `Qtile`
* `Polybar`
* `I3wm` 
* `Vim`
* `Ncspot`
* `Dunst` 
* `BetterDiscord` - in this repo you will find only transparent theme to Discord
* `Zsh`
* `Alacritty`

 ## Theming

1. Gtk theme - `Material-Black-Cherry`
2. Gtk icons - `Papirus-Dark`
3. Qt theme  - `Fluent-Dark` *remember to use Kvantum in order to make windows transparent*
4. Terminal font - `Noto Sans Mono`
5. Qtile bar icons font - `Arimo Nerd Font`

If you want to install those themes easily use `Lxappearance` for *GTK themes* and `Kvantum` with `qt5ct` for *Qt themes*.
