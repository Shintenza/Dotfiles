# Dotfiles

This is my collection of config files. If you like dark colors, simplicity and efficiency, probably you will like it. Whole configuration is original but feel free to modify it and simply use it. 

##This repo contains configs for:

* `Qtile`
* `Polybar`
* `I3wm` 
* `Vim`
* `Ncspot`
* `Dunst` 
* `BetterDiscord` - in this repo you will find only transparent theme to Discord
* `Zsh`
* `Alacritty`
